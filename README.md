### Why I built this project?

This is basically my first published project with react.

### What I learnt?

1. I learnt how to use props in react.
2. How to use "useState".
3. I also used glassmorphism for the first time. Done with tailwind though, not vanilla css.
4. The styling of this project was done with tailwind; making me learn how to use react with tailwindcss.

THANK YOU!ðŸš€
